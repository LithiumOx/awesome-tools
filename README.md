# awesome-tools
A publicly sourced list of cool tools I use and recommend.

The goal of this list is to provide a curated list of tools that are useful for developers, designers, and other tech professionals. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather a starting point for people looking for tools to help them do their job and or assignments.

Also if you know better alternatives to any of the tools listed here, please let me know.

Contact information can be found on my website and/or GitHub profile.

> This list is a work in progress. I'll be adding to it as I find new tools that I think are worth sharing. If you have any suggestions for tools that should be added to this list, please open an issue or a pull request.
